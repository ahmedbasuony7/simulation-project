 * EX. if t == 0 then the return value is A ==> A + (B - A)*0 = A
 *     if t == 1 then the return value is B ==> A + (B - A)*1 = A + B - A = B
 * @param {number} A - left point
 * @param {number} B - right point
 * @param {double} t - the ration between left and right point
 * @returns {double} - the linear interpolation between A and B

 *  Get the intersection between two segments - firstSegment(A,B) A = {x - coordinate ,y - coordinate}

 * Fact : The two segment can intersect if the linearInterpolation is equal's for them.
 *        Ix = Ax + (Bx - Ax)t = Cx + (Dx - Cx)u
 *        Iy = Ay + (By - Ay)t = Cy + (Dy - Cy)u
 *        Ix,Iy: coordinate if intersection point;
 *        - we have the coordinate for first and second segment(A,B,C,D), we need to find the value of e,u
 *        FOR X - Coordinate:
 *        => Ax + (Bx - Ax)t = Cx + (Dx - Cx)u ==> let's right u in term of t / -Cx
 *        => u(Dx - Cx) = (Ax - Cx) + (Bx - Ax)t ==> we can divide this equation by (Dx - Cx) but it can be zero so,
 *                                                   leave it like that (we will substitute this in another equation in future :) )
 *        FOR Y - Coordinate:
 *        => Ay + (By - Ay)t = Cy + (Dy - Cy)u ==> let's right u in term of t / -Cy
 *        => u(Dy - Cy) = (Ay - Cy) + (By - Ay)t / *(Dx - Cx)
 *        => u(Dx - Cx)(Dy - Cy) = (Ay - Cy)(Dx - Cx) + (Dx - Cx)(By - Ay)t ==> we can now substitute u(Dx - Cx) in this equation by

 *        => (Ax - Cx)(Dy - Cy) + (Bx - Ax)(Dy - Cy)t = (Ay - Cy)(Dx - Cx) + (Dx - Cx)(By - Ay)t / -(Dx - Cx)(By - Ay)t
 *                                                                                               / -(Ax - Cx)(Dy - Cy)
 *        => (Bx - Ax)(Dy - Cy)t - (Dx - Cx)(By - Ay)t = (Ay - Cy)(Dx - Cx) - (Ax - Cx)(Dy - Cy) / take t as a factor
 *        => t ((Bx - Ax)(Dy - Cy) - (Dx - Cx)(By - Ay)) = (Ay - Cy)(Dx - Cx) - (Ax - Cx)(Dy - Cy) /divide by ((Bx - Ax)(Dy - Cy) - (Dx - Cx)(By - Ay))

 *
 *        - in our code we will divide equation above to two parts
